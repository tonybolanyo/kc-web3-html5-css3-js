KeepCoding html5, css3 y javascript basic module project.

## The challenge

Some restrictions are applied in the original project:

- no bootstrap o any CSS library
- must run in modern browsers and IE11
- some guides and requisites for content and organizacion of sections

To make it funnier I decide I can't use jQuery, make my own icon fonts (not draw the icons) and edit my own video. This is the result.

Contact form doesn't send anything, only use notifications API to show a message in the browser.

The trivia game uses Open [Trivia Database as backend](https://opentdb.com/) to get all the questions.
